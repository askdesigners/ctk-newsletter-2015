Built with Wintersmith.

## Deployment instructions

The directory `/build` contains all the built files which are ready to be deployed in their final location. This directory is the root directory of the site. Do not deploy anything but that directory.
Please double check that all the links and images are working correctly, as we are not able to fully test them without access to the production server. 

___

## Making updates

All source files for the site are in the `/contents` directory, and can be built using the static site generator [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/). 

Install Wintersmith, and run the command `wintersmith build` to compile the files.
